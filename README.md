# first_uni_web_project
This project is a simple cooking website created using HTML and CSS. It features a clear layout for presenting various recipes. The initial design used very bright colors, which have been adjusted for a more refined visual appeal. The website is designed to be responsive and includes HTML, CSS, and image assets.
